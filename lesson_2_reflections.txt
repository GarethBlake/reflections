What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
In the directory type git init and a .git directory is created with the relevant init files and directories
git status show that there are no commits and no files being tracked - any files are untracked
This is because there is no point tracking all files, just the ones that matter!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
Staging is about things which are ready for a commit

What value do you think it offers?
Allows time to change mind before a commit, even change the files between commits, adding and removing files.
