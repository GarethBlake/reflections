When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share my work
To backup
Help move between computers
To collaborate

git pull origin master
(brings in content from remote repository, this file in this case)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The additions might interfere with what is present locally. Might upset current local work.
Remote changes might not be in a suitable state to pull yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A branch exists in a repository, it is the code branch indicating the sources of this part of the code
A clone is a copy of a particular repository, it can be local to local or remote to local
A fork is a clone on GitHub, used to acknowledge and borrow someone elses repository.
The fork can be changed without affecting the original

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
