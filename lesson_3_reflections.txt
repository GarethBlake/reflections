When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share my work
To backup
Help move between computers
To collaborate

git pull origin master
(brings in content from remote repository, this file in this case)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The additions might interfere with what is present locally. Might upset current local work.
Remote changes might not be in a suitable state to pull yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A branch exists in a repository, it is the code branch indicating the sources of this part of the code
A clone is a copy of a particular repository, it can be local to local or remote to local
A fork is a clone on GitHub, used to acknowledge and borrow someone elses repository.
The fork can be changed without affecting the original

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
This facilitates offline working. So can continue working on a branch and merge later.
git log and git status commands do not need access to remote repository to work.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
Collaboration manually would make offline working easy but file sharing tricky.
File merging would be manual and very difficult.
Changes would have to be serial, one person at a time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
Sharing debugged and agreed code in master, use it as the definitive tested and accepted version.
Branches can be used to discuss possible changes and get them right before merging with the main code
